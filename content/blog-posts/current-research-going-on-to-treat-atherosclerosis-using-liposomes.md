Liposomeâ€™s implementation mainly depends on its capability to target atherosclerotic lesions/plagues. There are various novel strategies developed to target endothelium, plagues, and macrophages. By enhanced permeability and retention plaques can be easily targeted. Damaged endothelium overexpresses some specific biomarkers like VCAM1, ICAM1, and LOX-1. Antibodies against biomarkers is attached to target the damaged endothelium. Research done anti-VCAM1 and anti-ICAM1 liposomes used to target endothelial cells. LOX-1 receptor is another target for liposomes due to receptor upregulation on endothelium resulting into secretion of cytokines which leads to inflammation. Specific targeting of

<div style="text-align: justify">The repercussions of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) include myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, and angina pectoris, which are the main causes of mortality and morbidity worldwide. In atherosclerosis, inflammation in arterial wall is the main cause behind CVD. Due to dysregulated cholesterol metabolism and maladaptive immune response, plaques are formed. ASCVD can be treated by angioplasty and also by administering drugs like anti-inflammatory, fibrates, statins etc. There are various side effects attached to it like in many causes after 6 months of angioplasty plaques are being formed again. Various adverse effects caused by drugs are muscle pain, osteoporosis, fatigue, and weakness. Effective therapeutic approaches to counter atherosclerosis while bypassing the adverse effects of traditional anti-inflammatory drugs will advance the healthcare of CVD patients. Liposomes can be modified to target plaque and also used for the delivery of drugs. Liposomes are biocompatible and non-toxic structures, comprising of phospholipids, which self-assemble in water and form layered vesicles.</div>

<div style="text-align: justify">Liposomeâ€™s implementation mainly depends on its capability to target atherosclerotic lesions/plaques. There are various novel strategies developed to target the endothelium, plaques, and macrophages. By enhanced permeability and retention, plaque can be easily targeted. Damaged endothelium overexpresses some specific biomarkers like vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM1), intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM1), and lectin-type oxidized LDL receptor 1 (LOX-1). Antibodies against biomarkers is attached to target the damaged endothelium. Scientific research found that anti-VCAM1 and anti-ICAM1 liposomes can be used to target endothelial cells and are very effective. LOX-1 receptor is another target for liposomes due to the receptor upregulation on endothelium resulting into secretion of cytokines which leads to inflammation. Specific targeting of liposomes by attaching antibodies creates a difficulty by increasing immune recognitions of liposomes. It causes faster removal of liposomes from the circulatory system. To overcome this problem density of liposomes must be optimized. Despite promising results, it is problematic because blood flow in the vessels creates shear stress at endothelial cells. Macrophages can be used as another approach to treat atherosclerosis. Presence of phosphatidylserine on the surface of an apoptotic cell leads to identification and engulfment of macrophages. Incorporating PS anti liposomes to help identify macrophage brings the macrophages to the site of lesion thus making it a rich site containing macrophages. Receptors like CDR6, gAD (binds due to the presence of adinopectin) and Folate receptor Beta present on the surface of macrophages can be used as a target for liposomes. Fibrous cap is also used as target for liposomes to treat atherosclerosis. Various antifibrinogenic conjugated liposome studies on animal models have shown satisfactory results.</div>

<div style="text-align: justify">Cholesterol is the main cause of plaque progression. Reducing the cholesterol in the body can used to treat atherosclerosis. In one study of the expression of genes involved in the efflux of cholesterol in an LDLR mouse model in which the mice consumed a cholesterol-rich diet showed that nanoliposomes upregulated ATP binding cassette subfamily A member 1 (ABCA1) and subfamily G member 1 (ABCG1) genes. Negatively charged phospholipids containing liposomes e.g., phosphatidylcholine and diasteroyl phosphatidylglycerols can increase reverse cholesterol transport which helps to decrease the available cholesterol at vascular wall. ABC transporters act as an intermediate in cholesterol efflux pathways, also they control and propagation and mobilization of haematopoietic system and progenitor cells present in bone marrow.</div>

<div style="text-align: justify">In atherosclerosis liposomes can be used as a potential drug delivery carrier for anti-inflammatory drugs and antiangiogenic drugs. Glucocorticoids are mainly used as anti-inflammatory drugs for ASCVD. Delivering glucocorticoids with liposomes decrease the adverse effects when administered orally. It also increases the half-life of glucocorticoids, so frequency of dose also decreases. Loading glucocorticoids into PEGylated liposomes increases the circulation time and improves their accumulation in atherosclerotic lesions. Research done on Prednisolone phosphate when PEGylated used to target lesions showed good results. Major drawback of prednisolone loaded liposome is lipotoxicity which might worsen ASCVD. First clinical trial done on prednisolone in 2015 has shown some increase in plasma life but it did not show any decrease in inflammation. There are various other anti-inflammatory drugs like corticosteroids and chemokines antagonists and can be incorporated in liposomes to decrease the inflammation. Anti-angiogenic drugs like bevacizumab when loaded with liposomes has shown good results. This drug helps in inhibition of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and ceases the development of lesions.</div>
